\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
In software development, listening to the users through usability tests is important. It allows product teams to gain a more realistic picture of the application they are working on, increasing quality. It also increases transparency with their users, making the users feel more heard. 

The IT department of the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) is responsible for developing and running NAV's IT-systems. The product-teams at NAV IT are organized as autonomous and are mostly working on IT-systems for serving benefits and social-services to the citizens of Norway. The product-teams are organized cross-functionally, where most teams include: a software developer, a designer and, a legal advisor. Most of the product-teams follows the principles of Agile with rapid feedback for the particular IT-system the product-teams are developing, which includes feedback on the usability of the particular IT-system. To gain usability feedback, it is necessary to meet NAV's users by performing usability tests. However it is an increasing challenge for the product-teams to meet users for usability tests. A part of this is that there is no standardisation of tools used for the recruitment of candidates for usability tests. The product-teams at NAV also find it challenging to find candidates with the correct qualification, as the specific IT-systems usually target a specific set of users. This has lead to NAV IT starting the initiative of Innbyggerpanelet, a digital solution for recruitment of candidates for usability tests.

Innbyggerpanelet is a proposed digital solution for the recruitment of participants for usability testing at NAV. All Norwegian citizens can give consent to be available for usability testing in Innbyggerpanelet. When consenting each citizen register relevant criteria, such as age, disabilities, area of residence, etc. NAV employees can then search for citizens with a specific set of critia and invite the most relevant participants for usability tests. It is also proposed that Innbyggerpanelet should be made accessible to the rest of the employees of the Norwegian public sector, functioning as a national database of participants for usability testing.

However even if you have a digital solution that makes the management of recruiting candidates simpler, related papers suggest its a challenge to make candidates participate a usability test. From a user base of 200 users, 52 consented to participate in a study, while only 9 participants (17\%) completed the study [\cite{pkf_2018}]. Improper incentive might also lead to the participants registered in such a system not completing the study due to them feeling like its not worth their time and effort to participate [\cite{pkf_2018}]. These factors might suggest that digital solutions like Innbyggerpanelet need a large user-base before it can be of value to the product teams at NAV.

As comparable to clinical trials, NAV's studies calls for participants with a particular set of criteria, such as age, gender, life status, job status etc. This can exclude a large portion of the participants available in Innbyggerpanelet, slowing down recruitment and preventing new participants to be included in the studies [\cite{nc_2020}]. This means that the criteria for participants collected by Innbyggerpanelet needs to be specific enough to be helpful, while not being too specific, excluding a large amount of potential participants.

Newly employed designers at NAV IT have also stated that performing usability tests is different at NAV then private sector. Also stating that the newly employed designers do not know how usability testing is performed at NAV, thus not knowing the challenges of performing usability tests in the Norwegian public sector. There has also been a lack of focus on the quality of usability of NAV's IT-systems [NAV presentation, User-meetings as of February 2022]. This lack of focus might mean that there are undiscovered issues in usability testing, due to the lack of performing usability testing.

\subsection{Project Goals and Research Questions}
The intended goal of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of what are the challenges of performing usability tests in the Norwegian public sector. It also intends to understand if proposed solutions such as Innbyggerpanelet actually are solutions to aid in usability testing, or just attacks symptoms of challenges in recruitment of candidates for usability tests at in the Norwegian public sector. Conducting a literature review on these topics will give a basis for answering the following research questions: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} What are the challenges of performing usability tests in the Norwegian public sector?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} What are the specific challenges in recruitment of qualified candidates to usability tests in the Norwegian public sector?
\end{itemize}

Section 3 explains the process on how the literature review for the research was conducted. Section 4 provides the results discovered in the literature review that were relevant for the research questions. Section 5 discusses the results in the context of the public sector and. Section 6 provides a summary of the report and its findings, as well as what future work should be conducted.
