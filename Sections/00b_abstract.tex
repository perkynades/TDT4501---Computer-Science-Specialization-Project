The aim of this paper is trough an literature review, to answer the research questions on what is the challenges in usability testing and the challenges in recruitment to usability tests in the Norwegian public sector. The research has found that there is several challenges in usability testing, such as: (1) number of participants, (2) usability testing not always the correct tool, (3) usability testing used as a science, (4) problems during a usability test, and (5) usability testing and agile software development. Several challenges in recruitment for usability testing were also uncovered: (1) monetary incentives, (2) logistical incentives, (3) participant and researcher interactions, (4) ineffective marketing, and (5) crowdsourcing. However these findings are limited due to a lack of papers with the context of the public sector, hence further research on the challenges in usability testing the public sector is encouraged to be explored.
